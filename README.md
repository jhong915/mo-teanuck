I'm here to create a better world for my children through FOSS. 

There is an objective reality, which is experienced subjectively through our individual consciousness. 
It is hard to believe that this statement might be viewed as controversial.

I will not live a life of lies in a society built on deceit, corruption, and fraud. 

My desire to live according to these principles has drawn me to computer programming. Computers cannot be swayed by wealth or power into denying that 0 is 0 and 1 is 1. 

I don't know what my new life as a programmer will lead to but I need to spend my life energy on truth and building a world that respects truth.
